"""
The Stream format output file is composed of variable length records. The
minimum record length is four bytes. Records can be infinitely long. The
first four bytes of a record are the header. The first two bytes of the header
contain a count (in eight-bit bytes) of the total record length. The count
tells you where one record ends and another begins. The next record begins
immediately after the last byte included in the count.

The third byte of the header is the record type. The fourth byte of the header
describes the type of data contained within the record. The fifth through last
bytes of a record are data. Figure 2-1 shows a typical record header.
